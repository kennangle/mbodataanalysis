# Mindbody Data Analysis SaaS Platform

## Overview
An enterprise-grade analytics platform designed to import and analyze data from Mindbody (covering students, classes, schedules, attendance, memberships, purchases, and income). It features AI-powered natural language querying via OpenAI API, a real-time analytics dashboard, custom report generation, role-based access control, and comprehensive business intelligence capabilities. The platform addresses the challenge of long-running data imports by implementing a robust, resumable background import system, ensuring reliable data synchronization for large datasets.

## Recent Changes

### October 16, 2025 - Cancel Import Feature üõë
**Problem Solved:** Users needed ability to stop long-running imports (especially when hitting API rate limits or importing wrong date ranges). Solution: Cancel button with comprehensive race condition protection.

#### Implementation
- **Cancel API endpoint** - `POST /api/mindbody/import/:id/cancel`
  - Sets job status to 'paused' with error 'Cancelled by user'
  - Preserves progress and offset for resumability
  - Authorization checks: auth + organization ownership
  
- **Triple race condition protection** in worker
  - **Pre-processing check**: Skips queued jobs that were cancelled before worker starts
  - **Batch-level checks**: Verifies job status before each batch, stops immediately if paused
  - **Data-type-level checks**: Checks status after each data type, prevents marking cancelled jobs as completed
  
- **UI/UX enhancements**
  - Cancel button appears during active imports
  - Resume button appears for cancelled/paused jobs
  - Toast notifications for cancel/resume actions
  - Polling stops when job is cancelled

#### Testing Results
‚úÖ Cancel during active processing ‚Üí Job stays 'paused', Resume button appears  
‚úÖ Cancel doesn't mark job as 'completed' ‚Üí Protection verified  
‚úÖ Cancel queued job ‚Üí Only minimal imports (1 record), job stays 'paused'

#### Architect Reviewed & Approved ‚úÖ
- All race conditions addressed
- Queued and in-flight jobs halt properly
- No jobs marked completed after cancellation
- Production-ready with low cancellation latency

### October 15, 2025 - Resumable Background Import System üöÄ
**Problem Solved:** Replit's HTTP/2 proxy closes long-running connections, causing imports to fail with `ERR_CONNECTION_CLOSED`. Solution: Background job processing with checkpoint/resume.

#### Architecture Overhaul
- **Database-backed job queue** with PostgreSQL persistence
  - New `importJobs` table tracks status, progress, current offset, errors
  - Survives HTTP connection timeouts and page reloads
  - Multi-tenant safe with organization isolation
  
- **Background worker system** processes imports asynchronously
  - Jobs run in background, survive HTTP connection closes
  - Sequential job queue - processes jobs in order, never drops requests
  - Updates database after every batch with checkpoint data
  
- **Sequential batching strategy** for API rate limiting
  - Clients/Classes: 200 records per batch
  - Visits/Sales: 100 records per batch  
  - 200-250ms delays between batches
  - Replaced p-limit concurrent processing (caused timeouts)

#### API Endpoints (New)
- `POST /api/mindbody/import/start` - Create import job, start background worker
- `GET /api/mindbody/import/active` - Fetch active job for current org (page reload support)
- `GET /api/mindbody/import/:id/status` - Get real-time job status and progress
- `POST /api/mindbody/import/:id/resume` - Resume paused/failed jobs from checkpoint
- Legacy `/api/mindbody/import` kept for backward compatibility

#### Frontend Features
- **Real-time progress tracking** via polling (every 2 seconds)
  - Shows current data type being imported
  - Progress bar with percentage complete
  - Per-type progress details (clients, classes, visits, sales)
  
- **Session resilience** - page reload recovery
  - Fetches active job on mount using `/active` endpoint
  - Auto-resumes polling if import is running
  - Users can safely close browser while import continues
  
- **Resume capability** for failed/paused jobs
  - Resume button appears for failed imports
  - Picks up from last checkpoint (offset preserved)
  - Shows error message for debugging

#### Token Caching & Auth
- Caches Mindbody user token for 55 minutes (expires in 60)
- Eliminates hundreds of redundant `/usertoken/issue` calls
- Auto-retry with fresh token on 401 authentication errors

#### Performance Characteristics
- **No more connection timeouts** - imports run indefinitely in background
- 6,500 clients (6 months): ~15-25 minutes
- 20,000+ clients (6 months): ~27-45 minutes (40,000+ API calls)
- Safe for datasets of any size - checkpointed progress
- Respects Mindbody's 30 req/sec API rate limit

#### Architect Reviewed & Approved ‚úÖ
- Job queue prevents dropped requests
- Frontend restores active jobs on mount
- Checkpoint/resume logic verified
- Multi-tenant isolation confirmed
- Production-ready for large-scale imports

### Core Features & Implementations
- **Resumable Background Import System**: Addresses HTTP connection timeouts by using a database-backed job queue for asynchronous, checkpointed data imports. Features sequential batching for API rate limiting, real-time progress tracking, session resilience, resume capabilities for failed jobs, and cancel functionality with triple race condition protection to stop imports immediately without wasting API quota.
- **Automatic Pagination**: Implements a generic `fetchAllPages<T>()` helper to ensure all records are fetched from Mindbody API, regardless of volume. Includes performance optimizations for large datasets using in-memory lookups.
- **User Management**: Comprehensive admin-only interface for managing users within an organization, featuring add/edit/delete functionality, role-based access control (admin/user), and tenant isolation.
- **Dashboard & Analytics**: Replaces mock data with live database queries for charts like Revenue & Growth Trend and Class Attendance by Time. Optimized SQL queries for performance and handles empty states gracefully.
- **Configurable Imports**: Allows users to specify date ranges and data types (Clients, Classes, Visits, Sales) for imports, with backend support for selective fetching and dynamic success messages.
- **Authentication**: Session-based authentication using Passport.js with scrypt for password hashing. Mindbody API uses User Token authentication (staff-level access) with token caching.
- **Database Schema**: Comprehensive PostgreSQL schema with 10 tables (Users, Organizations, Students, Classes, ClassSchedules, Attendance, Revenue, AIQueries, Sessions, ImportJobs), supporting multi-tenancy via `organizationId` and optimized with indexing.

### API Endpoints
- `/api/auth/*`: Authentication (login, register, logout, me)
- `/api/students`: Student management (search, pagination)
- `/api/classes`: Class management
- `/api/attendance`: Attendance tracking
- `/api/revenue`: Revenue data and statistics
- `/api/dashboard/stats`: Aggregated dashboard metrics
- `/api/mindbody/import`: Direct Mindbody data import (legacy)
- `/api/mindbody/import/start`: Initiates a background import job
- `/api/mindbody/import/active`: Fetches active import job status for current organization
- `/api/mindbody/import/:id/status`: Retrieves real-time status of a specific import job
- `/api/mindbody/import/:id/resume`: Resumes a paused/failed import job
- `/api/mindbody/import/:id/cancel`: Cancels a running/pending import job
- `/api/dashboard/revenue-trend`: Returns 12 months of revenue and student counts
- `/api/dashboard/attendance-by-time`: Returns attendance by day/time slot

## Known Limitations

### Duplicate Prevention
- ‚úÖ **Clients/Students**: Implemented upsert logic - updates existing records instead of creating duplicates
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Visits/Attendance**: Still creates duplicates on re-import (needs upsert logic)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Sales/Revenue**: Still creates duplicates on re-import (needs upsert logic)

**Recommendation:** Clear attendance and revenue data before re-importing to avoid duplicates, or import only new date ranges.

## External Dependencies
- **Mindbody Public API**: Used for importing client, class, visit, and sales data. Authenticates using API Key and User Tokens (staff credentials `_YHC` with `MINDBODY_CLIENT_SECRET`).
- **OpenAI API**: Integrated for AI-powered natural language querying capabilities.
- **Neon (PostgreSQL)**: Cloud-hosted PostgreSQL database service for data persistence.
