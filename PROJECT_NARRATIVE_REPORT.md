## 1. Project Genesis & Problem Statement

### The Challenge
Yoga Health Centre (and similar Mindbody studios) faced several critical challenges:

1. **Data Locked in Mindbody**: Business data scattered across multiple Mindbody reports with limited analytical capabilities
2. **No Historical Trend Analysis**: Unable to track performance over time or identify patterns
3. **Manual Report Generation**: Hours spent manually exporting and analyzing data in spreadsheets
4. **Limited Business Intelligence**: No way to ask natural language questions like "Which students are at risk of churning?" or "What's our intro-to-membership conversion rate?"
5. **No Real-Time Visibility**: Import processes running without progress visibility, causing confusion and blocking workflow

### The Vision
Build a professional SaaS platform that:
- Automatically synchronizes all Mindbody data (students, classes, attendance, revenue)
- Provides interactive dashboards with real-time analytics
- Enables AI-powered natural language querying
- Supports multiple organizations with complete data isolation
- Handles large-scale data imports reliably with progress visibility
- Ensures data accuracy and integrity

## 3. Major Feature Milestones (Chronological)

### Phase 1: Foundation (Early Development)
**Core Infrastructure**
- Multi-tenancy database schema with 12+ tables (users, organizations, students, classes, schedules, visits, sales, memberships, import_jobs, scheduled_imports, sessions, password_reset_tokens)
- User authentication with email/password and Google OAuth 2.0
- Secure password reset flow with token-based verification
- Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Viewer)

### Phase 2: Data Synchronization
**Manual Import System**
- Configurable date range selection for targeted data fetching
- Multi-type data import: Students, Classes, Schedules, Attendance (Visits), Revenue (Sales)
- Mindbody API integration with automatic pagination helper
- Import history tracking with status indicators

**Critical Challenge**: Initial imports would crash on large datasets due to memory constraints and fail silently when connections dropped.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented batch processing (100 students at a time) reducing memory from ~5GB to ~50MB
- Added database connection retry logic with exponential backoff
- Built resumable import system with checkpoint persistence

### Phase 3: Resilient Background Import System (Major Milestone)
**The Problem**: Large imports (6+ months of data, 10,000+ students) would take hours and were prone to:
- Browser tab closures killing the import
- Memory exhaustion crashes
- Database connection timeouts
- No visibility into progress

**The Solution - Resumable Background Jobs**:
- **Database-backed job queue**: Jobs persist across server restarts
- **Auto-resume on startup**: Interrupted jobs automatically restart from last checkpoint
- **Real-time progress tracking**: Live updates on student batches processed, records imported, API calls made
- **Session resilience**: Jobs continue even if user closes browser
- **Proper cancellation handling**: Clean shutdown without orphaned resources
- **Watchdog system**: Detects and fails stalled jobs (5-minute staleness threshold)
- **Auto-cleanup**: Removes completed jobs after 30 days

**Technical Implementation**:
- Worker process polls job queue every 5 seconds
- Heartbeat updates every 30 seconds during processing
- Progress stored as JSON: `{apiCallCount, importStartTime, visits: {current, total, imported, completed}}`
- Collision detection prevents concurrent imports
- Memory usage logging for monitoring

### Phase 4: Memory Optimization (Critical Fix - October 2025)
**The Issue**: Visit imports were reloading 111,742 class schedules for every batch of 100 students, causing cumulative memory allocations of ~5GB and crashes on multi-month imports.

**The Fix**: Cache class schedules once per import run
- Load schedules on first batch, reuse for all subsequent batches
- Reduced memory from ~5GB cumulative to ~50MB one-time load
- Enabled 6+ month imports on Autoscale deployment tier
- Visit processing time improved from hours to minutes

### Phase 5: Scheduled Automatic Imports
**Feature**: Node-cron powered scheduler for hands-free data synchronization
- Per-organization cron jobs with configurable schedules
- Default: Daily at 2 AM for overnight data sync
- Manual "Run Now" triggers for immediate execution
- Automatic schedule updates when configuration changes
- Collision detection prevents overlapping imports
- Configurable date ranges and data types

**Critical Fix (October 2025)**: 
- Fixed dataTypes array handling in scheduler
- Implemented job completion polling with 4-hour timeout
- Added comprehensive edge case handling for stuck jobs
- Jobs now reliably transition to success/failed status

**Revenue Import Guidance**: Use "last 1 day" date range for scheduled imports due to Mindbody API limitations on historical queries

### Phase 6: Real-Time Webhook Integration
**Feature**: Instant data synchronization via Mindbody webhooks
- HMAC-SHA256 signature verification for security
- Event deduplication to prevent double-processing
- Asynchronous event processing for scalability
- Automatic attendance record creation on visit events
- Supports organizations with premium Mindbody accounts

### Phase 7: Data Quality & Integrity (Critical - October 2025)
**The Problem**: Discovered 137,012 duplicate attendance records across 4,224 students, inflating all analytics by 2-3x.

**Root Cause**: Same student attending same class on same day created multiple records.

**The Fix**:
- Implemented unique constraint on `(organizationId, studentId, scheduleId, attendedAt::date)` with partial index for `status='attended'`
- Updated `storage.createAttendance()` to use `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`
- Re-imported clean data resulting in accurate counts matching Mindbody source
- All AI queries now return correct metrics

**Impact**: Analytics immediately became accurate and trustworthy for business decisions.

### Phase 8: Analytics & Dashboards

**Dashboard Features**:
- Revenue & Growth Trend chart with date range filtering
- Class Attendance by Time visualization
- Quick date range selectors (Last Week, Month, Quarter, Year)
- Custom date picker for specific time periods
- Live database queries for real-time data

**KPI Dashboard (Comprehensive)**:
1. **KPI Overview Cards**: Total revenue, active members, avg class attendance, total classes
2. **Class Utilization Heatmap**: 7-day Ã— 24-hour grid with color-coded utilization percentages, highlights underperforming time slots (<80% threshold)
3. **Intro-to-Membership Conversion**: Funnel tracking intro class attendees and conversion rates
4. **Churn & Retention Metrics**: Active/inactive member counts, monthly new member trends with bar charts
5. **Class Performance Analysis**: Identifies underperforming classes below 80% capacity
6. **Membership Trends**: Visual bar charts showing membership growth over time

All KPIs support dynamic date range filtering with proper query parameter handling.

### Phase 9: AI-Powered Natural Language Queries

**Technology**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini with Function Calling

**Capabilities**: 6 specialized database query functions
1. `get_student_attendance`: Individual student attendance history and patterns
2. `get_top_students_by_attendance`: Leaderboard of most active students
3. `get_revenue_by_period`: Revenue analysis by time period
4. `get_class_statistics`: Class performance metrics and utilization
5. `get_student_revenue`: Individual student purchase history
6. `execute_custom_query`: Flexible SQL generation for complex questions

**Example Queries**:
- "Which students are at risk of churning?"
- "What's our intro-to-membership conversion rate this month?"
- "Which classes are underperforming?"
- "Show me revenue trends for the last quarter"

**Benefits**: Democratizes data access - users don't need SQL knowledge to get insights.

### Phase 10: Reports System

**Four Comprehensive Report Types**:
1. **Revenue Reports**: Sales analysis with filtering and CSV export
2. **Attendance Reports**: Student participation tracking
3. **Class Performance Reports**: Utilization and capacity analysis
4. **Monthly Summary Reports**: Holistic business overview

**Features**:
- Independent date selectors per report
- Quick range buttons (Last Week/Month/Quarter/Year)
- CSV export for Excel analysis
- Custom date range selection

### Phase 11: CSV Revenue Import (Critical - Mindbody API Limitation)

**The Problem**: Mindbody `/sale/sales` API endpoint ignores date range parameters and only returns ~10-20 recent sales, making historical data import impossible via API.

**The Solution**: CSV Import from Mindbody Business Intelligence Reports
- Flexible column mapping (Date/Description/Amount/Type)
- Client matching by Mindbody ID, email, or name
- Duplicate prevention via database constraints
- Bulk processing with progress tracking
- Successfully handles large datasets (22,000+ records)

**Workflow**:
1. Export sales report from Mindbody Business (Studio side)
2. Upload CSV to platform via Settings â†’ Data Import â†’ Revenue Import
3. System processes and imports with automatic deduplication

**Best Practice**: Use CSV import for historical revenue data, use scheduled API import with "last 1 day" range for ongoing daily sync.

### Phase 12: User Management (Admin Interface)

**Features**:
- CRUD operations for users (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Role assignment (Admin, Manager, Viewer)
- Multi-tenancy support with organization scoping
- User invitation system with email notifications

### Phase 13: Students Data Management

**Features**:
- Comprehensive student roster with advanced filtering
- Excel export functionality
- Quick search and sort capabilities
- Integration with attendance and revenue analytics

### Phase 14: Watchdog Job Queue Fix (Critical - October 2025)

**The Problem**: Watchdog incorrectly failed queued jobs that were waiting to be processed (status='pending'), causing false positives when multiple jobs were queued.

**Root Cause**: Watchdog checked for stale heartbeats on ALL jobs with status='running', but auto-resume set jobs to 'pending' when queuing, and worker only changed to 'running' when processing started.

**The Fix**: Proper job lifecycle implementation
- Auto-resume/scheduler set jobs to 'pending' status when queuing
- Import worker transitions to 'running' when processing starts
- Watchdog now only fails jobs with status='running' AND stale heartbeat (>5 min)
- Prevents false positives while catching genuinely stalled jobs

**Impact**: Enables reliable processing of large job queues (75+ concurrent jobs) without premature failures.

### Phase 15: Background Jobs Visibility Panel (Latest - October 24, 2025)

**The Problem**: Users couldn't see background jobs running, causing confusion when new imports were blocked. System would reject new imports saying "An import is already in progress" but users had no visibility into what was running.

**The Solution**: Active Background Jobs Panel
- New collapsible section in Data Import settings
- Shows all running/pending jobs with:
  - Status badges (Running/Pending)
  - Creation timestamps
  - Date ranges being processed
  - Data types being imported
  - Real-time progress bars with percentages
  - Current student batch being processed
- 5-second polling for live updates
- Defaults to open when active jobs exist
- Clear warning: "You cannot start new imports while these are running"

**Technical Implementation**:
- Backend endpoint: `/api/mindbody/import/active-jobs`
- Storage method: `getActiveImportJobs()` queries all running/pending jobs
- Frontend: TanStack Query with 5-second refetch interval
- Organization-scoped with proper authentication

**Impact**: Complete transparency into background operations, eliminating user confusion and improving UX significantly.

## 4. Critical Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Database Connection Resilience
**Problem**: Neon PostgreSQL terminates idle connections (error 57P01) during long-running imports, causing silent failures.

**Solution**: 
- Wrapped all database operations with `withDatabaseRetry()` helper
- Exponential backoff retry strategy (1s, 2s, 4s delays)
- Detects connection errors: 57P01, ECONNRESET, "connection terminated/closed/lost"
- Optimized connection pool: 30-second idle timeout
- Only retries connection-related failures, fails fast on other errors

**Coverage**: All read/write operations including shutdown handlers.

### Challenge 2: Memory Exhaustion on Large Imports
**Problem**: Loading all 10,000+ students into memory at once caused crashes.

**Solution**: Batch processing
- Process 100 students at a time
- Cache frequently-accessed data (class schedules) once per import
- Memory usage logging for monitoring
- 99% memory footprint reduction

### Challenge 3: Mindbody API Revenue Limitations
**Problem**: `/sale/sales` endpoint ignores date parameters, only returns recent sales.

**Solution**: Hybrid approach
- CSV import for historical data (authoritative source)
- Scheduled API import with "last 1 day" for ongoing daily sync
- Webhooks for real-time updates (premium accounts)

### Challenge 4: Data Quality - Attendance Duplicates
**Problem**: 137,012 duplicate attendance records inflating analytics by 2-3x.

**Solution**: 
- Unique database constraint on `(organizationId, studentId, scheduleId, attendedAt::date)`
- Modified insert logic to use `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`
- Re-imported clean data
- All metrics now accurate and match Mindbody source

### Challenge 5: Import Progress Visibility
**Problem**: Background jobs ran invisibly, users couldn't tell if imports were working.

**Solution**: 
- Real-time progress tracking with JSON-stored state
- Active Background Jobs panel with 5-second polling
- Progress bars showing percentage, current batch, records imported
- Import history with completion status

### Challenge 6: Job Queue Reliability
**Problem**: Watchdog failing queued jobs prematurely, concurrent job collisions.

**Solution**:
- Proper job lifecycle: pending â†’ running â†’ completed/failed
- Watchdog only fails truly stalled jobs (status='running' + stale heartbeat)
- Collision detection prevents concurrent imports
- Auto-cleanup of old jobs
