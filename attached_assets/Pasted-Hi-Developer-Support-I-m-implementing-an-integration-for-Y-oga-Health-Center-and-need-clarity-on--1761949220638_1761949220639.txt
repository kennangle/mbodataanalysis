Hi Developer Support,

I’m implementing an integration for ​Y​oga Health Center and need clarity on how processing fees and service fees/surcharges are represented and managed through the MINDBODY APIs.

Could you please confirm the following and point me to the relevant docs/sample payloads?


Creating/Importing Fees (Write Paths)


Is there an API-supported way to create or attach a fee line item (e.g., “Processing Fee” or “Service Fee/Surcharge”) to a sale/checkout?

If yes, which endpoints/objects support this (e.g., CheckoutShoppingCart, PurchaseContract, etc.) and what fields/schemas should be used (codes, item types, taxability flags)?

Are there constraints on fee naming, tax treatment, or caps? Any validation rules we should anticipate?


Reading/Reconciling Fees (Read Paths)


For transactions processed with MINDBODY Payments, are processing fees available via API as separate, itemized fields (vs. only implicit in net deposits/payouts)?

Which read endpoints expose fee details (e.g., Sales, Purchases, Payments, PaymentTransactions, Payouts/Deposits if available)?

Are fees broken out at the line-item level or only at the payment/settlement level? Please specify the objects/fields.


Historical/Backfill


Is there official support to backfill historical fee data via API or export services? If API isn’t supported, what is the recommended approach (data export program, report endpoints, or partner services)?


Refunds/Chargebacks/Adjustments


How are fee reversals or chargeback fees represented via API?

Are there webhook events we can subscribe to for adjustments, and do those payloads include fee components?


Surcharging vs. Convenience Fees (Compliance & Configuration)


Does MINDBODY support card surcharging or convenience fees configuration natively, and can those be set/updated via API?

If not, is the recommended workaround to create a fee as a product/service and add it as a normal line item at checkout?


Multiple Merchant Accounts / Payment Types


If a business uses multiple processors or flows (in-person vs. ecommerce), can we differentiate fee sources in API responses (e.g., fields identifying processor, MID/TID, channel)?


Sandbox & Examples


Is there a sandbox object set that includes sample transactions with fees, refunds, and chargebacks for end-to-end testing?

Could you share example requests/responses that illustrate best practice for (a) adding a fee to a sale, and (b) reading fees for reconciliation?

Context:


Goal: Accurate P&L and reconciliation in a data warehouse (line-item truth for sales, taxes, discounts, and fees).

Stack: We’re pulling MINDBODY into an analytics pipeline and need deterministic mappings for fee fields.

If helpful, I can share our specific account/app details for deeper investigation.

Thanks in advance for the guidance and links.

Best regards
