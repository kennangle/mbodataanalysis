# Security Guidelines Document for Mindbody Data Analysis

This document outlines the security guidelines to be followed in the development and deployment of the Mindbody Data Analysis platform. It is essential to adhere to these guidelines to ensure the security and integrity of user data and system operations.

## Authentication & Authorization Rules

### OAuth Flows

- **OAuth 2.0 Implementation**: Use OAuth 2.0 for securing API endpoints.
- **Access Tokens**: Use short-lived access tokens and refresh tokens for session management.
- **Scopes**: Define and enforce specific scopes for API endpoints to limit access based on roles and permissions.

### JWT Handling

- **Secure Storage**: Store JWTs securely in the browser, using HTTP-only cookies where possible.
- **Signature Verification**: Always verify the signature of incoming JWTs to ensure their integrity.
- **Expiration**: Implement token expiration checks and refresh tokens as needed.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- **User Roles**: Define clear roles (e.g., Admin, Instructor, Student) with specific permissions.
- **Access Control**: Ensure that each role has access only to the resources necessary for their function.
- **Policy Management**: Regularly review and update access control policies.

## Data Validation Rules

### Input Sanitization

- **Sanitize All Inputs**: Use libraries to sanitize input data to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other attacks.
- **Whitelist Validation**: Validate inputs against a whitelist of acceptable values wherever possible.

### Type Checking

- **Static Typing**: Utilize TypeScript for static type checking to catch type errors during development.
- **Boundary Validation**: Implement checks for expected data boundaries to prevent buffer overflow and similar attacks.

## Environment Variables

### Secure Storage

- **Sensitive Information**: Keep API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive information in environment variables.
- **Access Control**: Limit access to these variables to authorized personnel only.
- **Secrets Management**: Use a secrets management service to store and manage environment variables securely.

## Rate Limiting/Throttling

### Request Limits

- **Endpoint Limits**: Define and enforce rate limits on API endpoints to prevent abuse.
- **User-Based Throttling**: Implement rate limiting per user/IP to mitigate DDoS attacks.

### DDoS Protection

- **Traffic Analysis**: Use anomaly detection to identify and mitigate potential DDoS attacks.
- **CDN Integration**: Leverage CDN capabilities to absorb and deflect malicious traffic.

## Error Handling & Logging

### Logging Practices

- **Sensitive Data**: Avoid logging sensitive data such as passwords or PII.
- **Log Retention**: Establish log retention policies and secure storage for log files.
- **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring tools to detect unusual activity patterns.

### Secure Error Messages

- **Minimal Information**: Provide minimal error details to users to avoid revealing system information.
- **Custom Error Pages**: Use custom error pages to handle errors gracefully without leaking sensitive information.

## Security Headers/Configs

### CORS Settings

- **CORS Policy**: Implement strict CORS policies to control which domains can access your resources.

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

- **CSP Implementation**: Define CSP to restrict resources loaded on the site to trusted sources.

### HTTPS Enforcement

- **SSL/TLS**: Use SSL/TLS to encrypt data in transit and enforce HTTPS for all connections.

## Dependency Management

### Package Management

- **Regular Updates**: Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Use tools to scan dependencies for vulnerabilities and apply patches promptly.

## Data Protection

### Encryption

- **Data at Rest**: Encrypt sensitive data stored in databases using industry-standard algorithms.
- **Data in Transit**: Use HTTPS/TLS for securing data in transit.

### PII Handling

- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary PII and ensure its secure handling and storage.
- **Access Controls**: Implement strict access controls for PII, limiting access to authorized personnel only.

By adhering to these security guidelines, the Mindbody Data Analysis platform will be better protected against security threats, ensuring the safety and privacy of user data. Regular reviews and updates to this document will help maintain the platform's security posture in the face of evolving threats.
