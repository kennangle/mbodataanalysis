dbe3b80d99f4273f.js:2 Cache data may be lost when replacing the gitHubInfoV2 field of a CurrentUser object.

This could cause additional (usually avoidable) network requests to fetch data that were otherwise cached.

To address this problem (which is not a bug in Apollo Client), either ensure all objects of type GitHubInfoV2 have an ID or a custom merge function, or define a custom merge function for the CurrentUser.gitHubInfoV2 field, so InMemoryCache can safely merge these objects:

  existing: {"__typename":"GitHubInfoV2","accessToken":"ghu_ALTOROt2wtVBYjDadPxLGAFbH9YdZr4WyHRx","userInfo":{"__typename":"GitHubUserInfo","name":null,"username":"kennangle","email":"ken@kennangle.com","avatarUrl":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/220625516?v=4"}}
  incoming: {"__typename":"GitHubInfoV2","accessToken":"ghu_ALTOROt2wtVBYjDadPxLGAFbH9YdZr4WyHRx"}

For more information about these options, please refer to the documentation:

  * Ensuring entity objects have IDs: https://go.apollo.dev/c/generating-unique-identifiers
  * Defining custom merge functions: https://go.apollo.dev/c/merging-non-normalized-objects
